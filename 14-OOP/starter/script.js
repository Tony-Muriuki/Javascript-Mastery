//Getters and Setters

//So every object in javascript has a common features called getters and setters.This special properties are what we call/Refer to as Assesor properties while the normal properties are refered to as data properties.So getters and setters are basically functions that get and set the value.

//Bank Account Example

const account = {
  owner: 'Jonas',
  movements: [200, 530, 120, 300],
  //We Want a Method To Get The Latest Movement(We add get to transform it to a getter....)
  get latest() {
    return this.movements.slice(-1).pop();
  },
  //Adding A setter Method(But any setter Method needs to have at least one )
  set latest(mov) {
    return this.movements.push(mov);
  },
};
console.log(account.latest);

//How do we use Setter

//---so if it was a regular Function we would have done : account.latest(50) but latest is moreof a property now than a ,ethod so we basically set it
account.latest = 50;
console.log(account.movements); //50 was added.

//Setters and Getters can actually Be Very Useful For Data Validation

//Lecture 228 STATIC Methods

//Static methods:This are methods that are defined on constructors or classes themselves ,not on the instances and are typically used as helper utilities tied to a class/constructors namespace

const Person = function (firtsName, birthYear) {
  this.firstName = this.firstName;
  this.birthYear = birthYear;
};
//Add Static Method
Person.hey = function () {
  console.log(this);
  console.log('Hey There ');
};
Person.hey();

// /Lecture 228 Object.create()

const PersonProt0 = {
  calcAge() {
    console.log(2037 - this.birthYear);
  },
  //Adding Method to Create Properties for us
  init(firstName, birthYear) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.birthYear = birthYear;
  },
};

const steven = Object.create(PersonProt0); //Here we pass in the object that we want it to be the prototype of the new object.
steven.name = 'Steven';
steven.birthYear = 2002;
steven.calcAge();
console.log(steven.__proto__ === PersonProt0);
console.log(PersonProt0.__proto__ === Object.prototype);
console.log(Object.prototype.__proto__ === null);

//New Object
const sarah = Object.create(PersonProt0);
sarah.init('Sarah', 1979);
sarah.calcAge();

/* 
1. Use a constructor function to implement a Car. A car has a make and a speed property. The speed property is the current speed of the car in km/h;
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console;
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console;
4. Create 2 car objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.

DATA CAR 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

/* 
1. Re-create challenge 1, but this time using an ES6 class;
2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide by 1.6);
3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6);
4. Create a new car and experiment with the accelerate and brake methods, and with the getter and setter.
