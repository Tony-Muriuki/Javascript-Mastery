// OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.

// Object oriented programming is a just but a programming paradigm (style of writing code) that is based on objects. Obhects can contain data which we call properties and code which we call methods . In OOP objects group data + code/behaviour into one self contained block.

// A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object created from a class is an instances and we can have multiple instances created from a class .

// There are 4 fundamental principles that can guide us towrds a good class implementation which are Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation ,and Inheritance.

// Abstraction
//So abstraction is one of the fundamentals of OOP in that it ignores or hides details that dont matter providing a simplified view(blackBox)eg: Phone analogy: Users see a screen and buttons while the other detailings like motherboard , chips , phone temperature and voltage are abstracted.
